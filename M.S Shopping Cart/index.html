<h1>Create a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </h1>

 <p>A web app that aids you maintain a shopping list that you can add items to and mark items as completed.<p>

    <div>

        Let me explain a bit further:
        
        You’re going to create a page that has a form.
        
Each time the form is filled, and a add button is clicked

The details of the form are converted into an item that gets added to our shopping list

Each item in the shopping list would have a button

When the button on an item is clicked, the item is removed from the shopping list

</div>

<div>

    This task has come requirements:
    
    You must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    
    Your page must not reload when an item is added to the shopping list.
    
    Your JavaScript must have at least one array variable that stores useful data
    
    Your JavaScript must contain at least one object.
    
    At least, some part of your code must be explained with comments
    
    Your code must use functions.
    
</div>
    
<h3>
If you’re confused on how the app would look, I’ve taken the stress of creating a beautiful design that can be found at
this link. You don’t have to follow the design (It would be nice if you did) but the design should give you a fair idea
of what needs to be done.</h3> -->
